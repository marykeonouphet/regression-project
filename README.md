# regression-project
Linear regression analysis was applied to a dataset on home prices in Saratoga, NY. A model for predicting home prices was created utilizing R programming.

The objective of this project was to apply methods and analysis used in linear regression with the purpose of fitting the best model for the dataset Houses in Saratoga County (2006), in which home price was the response variable.

There were 1728 observations in our dataset. 

The set contained sixteen variables: 
- price (response variable)
- lot size
- age
- land value
- living area square feet
- percentage of neighborhood that graduated college
- number of bedrooms
- number of fireplaces
- number of bathrooms
- total number of rooms in the home, e.g., bedrooms, bathrooms, kitchen, living room, etc.
- type of heating (electric, hot air, and hot water/steam)
- fuel type (electric, gas, and oil)
- sewer (septic, none, public/commercial)
- waterfront
- new construction
- central air

Six of these variables were categorical, of which three had two levels.

A prediction model was constructed meeting assumptions through a transformation of the response variable and adjusted for multicollinearity by variable selection.
